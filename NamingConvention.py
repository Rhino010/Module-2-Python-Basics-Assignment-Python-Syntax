# Task 1 Code Correction

# Original Code:
# Pi_value = 3.14
# userAge = 25
# user_location = "New York"
# MAXLIMIT = 1000

# The naming conventions should be snake case for all and any constants
# such as PI and something named MAX should be in all caps.
# I did not see anything wrong with the user_location = 'New York'
PI_VALUE = 3.14
user_age = 25
user_location = "New York"
MAX_LIMIT = 1000
